## Interative Plot with `plotly()` {#plotly}

Until now, all the plots we created are all static. In this section, we will introduce a powerful tool named `plotly()` that can make interactive plots. 

### Interactive scatterplots

Let's start with a static scatterplot and make it interactive. 

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(r02pro)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = gm2004) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = sugar, 
                           y = cholesterol))
```
