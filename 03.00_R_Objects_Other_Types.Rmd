# R Objects (II): Other Types {#object-other-type}

In Chapter \@ref(r-objects), we introduced **atomic vectors**. In a typical application, we usually need a more complex object type to represent the data. In this chapter, we will introduce a few commonly used object types including matrix in Section \@ref(matrix), array in Section \@ref(array), data frame in Section \@ref(dataframe), tibble in Section \@ref(tibble), and list in Section \@ref(list).
