## Numeric Vectors: Creating numeric vectors with patterns {#patterned_numeric_vectors_creation} 

In Section \@ref(intro-num-vector), you learned how to create numeric vectors with length more than 1 by using the `c()` function. When the number of elements become too big, you may feel redundant manually typing in all those elements. Luckily, as long as the assigned elements have certain patterns, R allows you to create the desired numeric vectors more efficiently.

### The colon operator `:` -- Equally-spaced numeric vectors with increment of 1 or -1

An equally-spaced numeric vector is a numeric vector with the same distance between adjacent elements. Suppose you want to assign consecutive integers from 1 to 5 to the name pattern1. Coming from Section \@ref(intro-num-vector), you may do the following:

```{r}
pattern1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

However, when the number of elements changes from 5 consecutive integers to 100 consecutive integers, manually typing in would be really time-consuming and inefficient. In R, you can use the colon operator `:` to create equally-spaced numeric vectors. Note that you don't need to use `:` together with `c()`.

```{r}
pattern2 <- 1:5
```

You can interpret the colon operator as "a numeric vector starting from 1 and ending at 5, with the increment between adjacent elements of 1". The colon operator is very powerful and convenient, as it can be used to create numeric vectors with any length of consecutive integers.



If you compare `pattern1` and `pattern2`, you will realize that they are both numeric vectors with elements of consecutive integers from 1 to 5. Let's experiment `:` with more attempts.


```{r}
pattern3 <- 5:1
pattern3
pattern4 <- 1.2:5.2
pattern4
```

Here, `pattern3` is a numeric vector with elements of consecutive integers from 5 to 1, and `pattern4` is a numeric vector with elements of consecutive decimals from 1.2 to 5.2.
 

However, as you can see below, R will store numeric vectors with equally-spaced integers as **type integer** and those with equally-spaced decimals as **type double**.

```{r}
class(pattern3)
class(pattern4)
```


### The `seq()` function -- Equally-spaced numeric vectors with any increment

As powerful as the colon operator `:` is, it is really restricted to creating equally-spaced numeric vectors with an increment 1 or -1. By contrast, the `seq()` function doesn't have such a restriction, and it will come into play when you want to create equally-spaced numeric vectors with increments other than 1 or -1.

***a. Create sequences with the `by` argument*** 

The `seq()` function can include three arguments: `from`, `to`, and `by`. The `from` and `to` arguments specify the start and limited end values, respectively, while the `by` argument specifies the increment of the sequence. 

```{r}
seq(from = 1, to = 5, by = 1)
seq(to = 5)
```





You can interpret the above example as "an equally-spaced numeric vector starting at 1 and ending at 5, with the increment between adjacent elements of 1". If you don’t specify the optional `from` and `by` arguments, `seq()` will use the default value 1 for both arguments.

::: {.infobox .caution data-latex="{caution}"}
Now you have had four methods to create vectors with consecutive integers. 
```{r, eval = F}
c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)           #write all numbers down
1:6                           #use colon operator
seq(from = 1, to = 6, by = 1) #use seq()
seq(to = 6)                   #use seq()
```
:::

Next, let's assign a different value to the `by` argument in the `seq()` function. What you will get a numeric vector with `1 3 5` as its values.

```{r}
seq(from = 1, to = 5, by = 2)
seq(from = 1, to = 6, by = 2)
```

Note that the ending value of the sequence doesn’t always match the value assigned to the `to` argument. If you change the limit end value to 6, you still get the same sequence, because the next value in the sequence would be 7, which exceeds the limit of 6. This is why `to` specifies the upper limit, not necessarily the last value in the sequence.


Of course, you can assign decimal numbers to arguments in the `seq()` function. Below, you will first get a sequence which starts with 1, increases by 0.5 each time until it is larger than 6. Subsequently, you will get a numeric vector with `1.1 1.8 2.5 3.2` as its values.

```{r}
seq(from = 1, to = 6, by = 0.5)
seq(from = 1.1, to = 3.2, by = 0.7)
```

Besides ascending sequences, you can also create descending sequences via `seq()` by using a negative value in the `by` argument. 

```{r, error=TRUE}
seq(from = 1.5, to = -1, by = -0.5)
seq(from = -3.5, to = -3, by = 0.1)
seq(from = 1.5, to = -1, by = 0.5)
```

It's worth noting that the arguments in `seq()` function should make algebraic sense. For example, in the last example above, it doesn't make sense to use a positive value in the `by` argument when the start value is bigger than the limited end value, which implies a decreasing sequence. In such cases, you will get an error message telling you that the sign in the `by` argument is wrong.


***b. Create sequences with the `length.out` argument*** 

In `seq()`, in addition to setting the increment via the `by` argument, you can also specify the `length.out` argument, which creates a equally-spaced sequence with the assigned length (a.k.a. the number of elements in the numeric vector). R will automatically calculate the difference between two neighboring elements according to values of three arguments in `seq()`.

```{r}
seq(from = 1, to = 5, length.out = 9)
```

Here, you will get an equally-spaced sequence of length 9 from 1 to 5. You can also create a decreasing sequence by using the `length.out` argument.

```{r}
seq(from = 5, to = -5, length.out = 9)
seq(from = 5, to = -5, length.out = 8.9)
```

::: {.infobox .caution data-latex="{caution}"}
Unlike creating sequences with `by` argument, if you specify the `length.out` argument in `seq()`, the start value and limited end value of the sequence you get will be exactly match the input arguments. 
::: 

***c. Create sequences with both the `by` and `length.out` arguments*** 

Lastly, if you provide both the `by` and `length.out` arguments, only one of the `from` and `to` arguments is necessary. With one value (the start value or the limit end value) fixed, `seq()` will create a vector with specified increment and length.

If you only have the `from` argument, you will get a sequence starting from the value you set, with the increment in the `by` argument, until you get a sequence with a length specified in the `length.out` argument.

If you only have the `to` argument, you will get a sequence ending with the value you set, with the increment in the `by` argument, until you get a sequence with a length specified in the `length.out` argument.

```{r}
seq(from = 1, by = 2, length.out = 5)
seq(to = 1, by = 2, length.out = 5)
```

Before finishing the `seq()` function, note that you should **at most** provide three arguments. For example, you will see an error when running the following example since all four arguments are specified.

```{r, error=TRUE}
seq(from = 1, to = 3, by = 1, length.out = 3)
```


### The sequence generator `seq_along()` -- Matching numeric vectors

Now, we will introduce one function derived from the `seq()` function. Let’s first create a numeric vector `extend`.

```{r}
extend <- seq(from = 2, to = 8, length.out = 7)
extend
```

By the value assigned to the `length.out` argument, you know that the length of `extend` is 7. You also know that `2 3 4 5 6 7 8` are the elements of `extend`. Next, let’s put `extend` in `seq_along()`.

```{r}
seq_along(extend)
```

As you can tell from the result, `seq_along()` takes a numeric vector as its argument, generating consecutive integers from 1 to the length of the input vector. The `seq_along()` function is commonly used when writing loops, which will be covered at a later time.

::: {.infobox .caution data-latex="{caution}"}
You can also use `1:length(extend)` to get the same result as `seq_along(extend)`.  However, `seq_along()` is more efficient and safer than `1:length(extend)` when the input vector is empty. For example, if you run `1:length(extend)` with an empty vector `extend`, you will get `1:0`, which is a numeric vector with values `1 0`. In contrast, `seq_along()` will correctly return a numeric vector with no elements.
```{r}
1:length(extend)
```
:::

### The `rep()` Function -- Numeric vectors with repeated values

The `rep()` function is designed for another type of patterned numeric vectors, which are with replicated values as their elements. To do repetition, you can use the `rep()` function, which works by repeating the first argument for the number of times indicated in the second argument. Suppose you want to assign four 2s to the name num1. You can use the `rep()` function here:

```{r}
num1 <- rep(2, 4)
num1
```

You can interpret the function as "creating a numeric vector in which 2 is repeated four times". The resulting vector is a length-4 numeric vector with all elements of value 2. In addition to one single value, a numeric vector with several values can be assigned in the first argument.

```{r}
num2 <- rep(c(1, 4, 2), 3)
num2
```

Here, the `rep()` will repeat the whole vector c(1, 4, 2) three times. Note that the vector is **repeated as a whole**, not element-wisely. Reflectively, you may be wondering what happens the second argument also has several elements? Let’s try together.

```{r}
num3 <- rep(c(1, 5, 7), c(3, 2, 1))
num3
```

In `rep()`, when the second argument is also a numeric vector, R will do an element-repeat-operation by repeating each element in the first argument the number of times indicated in the corresponding index of the second argument and combine the repeated vectors to a single numeric vector. In this example, 1 is repeated 3 times, 4 is repeated twice, and 7 is repeated once. It is equivalent to

```{r}
c(rep(1, 3), rep(4, 2), rep(7, 1))
```

It is important that, to assign two numeric vectors as the two arguments in `rep()`, the two numeric vectors should have the same length. Otherwise, you will see an error message telling you the second argument (a.k.a. the `times` argument) is invalid.

```{r, error=TRUE}
num4 <- rep(c(1, 5, 7), c(3, 2))
```

Last but not least, you can also apply `each` and `times` arguments in the `rep()` command. The former implies how many times each element in the vector of interest will be repeated per round, while the latter determines how many rounds the repeating will include.

```{r}
rep(c(1, 2), each = 3, times = 3)
```

### The `unique()` and `table()` Functions -- Getting unique elements and their frequencies

So far, you have learned how to create vectors with specific patterns. Sometimes, you may want to inspect the unique elements (elements with different values) in a numeric vector and their corresponding frequencies. Let’s use `num3` as an example. 

```{r}
num3
```

You can use `unique()` to show all unique elements in a vector.

```{r}
unique(num3)
```

From the result, you know the unique elements in `num3` are `1`, `5`, and `7`. To get the frequency of each element, you can use the `table()` function.

```{r}
table(num3)
```

Here, the first row is the numeric vector's name. The second row shows all unique elements, and the third row is their corresponding frequencies. In num3, there are three 1s, two 5s and one 7.
